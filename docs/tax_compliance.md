# Tax Compliance Requirements

## HST Compliance (Toronto, Ontario)

This document outlines the detailed requirements for registering for the Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) in Canada, including the definition and thresholds for a 'small supplier'. While not explicitly mentioning Ontario, the HST is applicable in Ontario, and these federal guidelines apply. Businesses generally must register if they are not a 'small supplier' and make taxable sales, leases, or other supplies in Canada (with specific exceptions for real property sales).

**General Registration Requirement:** You have to register for a GST/HST account if you are not a 'small supplier' and you make taxable sales, leases, or other supplies in Canada (unless your only taxable supplies are of real property sold other than in the course of a business).
**Small Supplier Definition:** A person whose revenue (along with the revenue of all persons associated with that person) from worldwide taxable supplies was equal to or less than a specified threshold in a single calendar quarter AND over the last four consecutive calendar quarters. The calculation excludes consideration attributable to the sale of goodwill of a business, supplies of financial services, and supplies by way of sale of capital property. Charities and public institutions have additional criteria.
**Small Supplier Thresholds:**
*   Most Businesses: {'threshold_amount': '$30,000', 'calculation_basis': 'Worldwide taxable supplies (including zero-rated supplies) from all businesses, including associates, before expenses. Excludes financial services, sales of capital property, and goodwill.', 'conditions_and_registration': [{'condition': 'Does NOT exceed $30,000 over four consecutive calendar quarters.', 'status': 'Small Supplier', 'action': 'Do NOT have to register. May choose to register voluntarily. Effective date of registration is usually the day of request (or up to 30 days prior).'}, {'condition': 'Exceeds $30,000 in a SINGLE calendar quarter.', 'status': 'No longer a Small Supplier', 'action': 'MUST register. Effective date of registration is NO LATER THAN the day of the supply that caused the threshold to be exceeded. Must start charging GST/HST on that supply. Register within 29 days of effective date.'}, {'condition': 'Exceeds $30,000 over the PREVIOUS FOUR (or fewer) consecutive calendar quarters (but not in a single quarter).', 'status': 'No longer a Small Supplier', 'action': 'MUST register. Effective date of registration is NO LATER THAN the beginning of the month AFTER you are no longer a small supplier. Must start charging GST/HST on taxable supplies from that date.

## US Tax Reporting Standards

The provided web content details U.S. sales tax obligations for Canada-based businesses selling products and services, including digital products, to U.S. customers. It extensively covers economic nexus rules, physical nexus triggers, tax registration requirements, collection and remittance processes, and filing procedures. It also provides a comparison between U.S. sales tax and Canada's GST/HST. The content focuses exclusively on sales tax and does not contain information on U.S. federal income tax requirements or specific tax treaty implications (such as the U.S.-Canada tax treaty) for either sales tax or income tax.

**Sales Tax Nature:** Consumption tax imposed on retail sales of goods and some services; no national sales tax, individual states and local jurisdictions set rates and rules.
**Nexus Triggers:**
*   **Economic Nexus:**
    *   Primary Thresholds: $100,000+ in sales OR 200+ transactions annually
    *   State Variations: Most states follow the $100,000 sales or 200 transactions standard; e.g., California uses a $500,000 threshold.
    *   Application: Applies to remote sellers with no physical presence but substantial sales in a state.
*   **Physical Nexus:**
    *   Triggers: U.S. warehouses, employees, offices, or Amazon FBA inventory.
**Tax Rates Variation:** Rates and regulations vary widely across individual U.S. states and sometimes local jurisdictions.

### Sales Tax on Digital Products (SaaS & Digital Services)
*   Subject to sales tax in numerous states, including Texas, Washington, and Pennsylvania. Taxability depends on each state's classification of digital goods. For example, Texas taxes SaaS as data processing, while California generally exempts it. Compliance obligations depend on customer locations (physical address, not IP), state-specific SaaS taxability rules, and revenue thresholds in nexus states.

### Collecting and Remitting U.S. Sales Tax
*   Calculate correct rates (state, county, local based on buyer's location – destination-based). Use taxability rules for products/services (some items are exempt). Set up tax collection at checkout (e.g., e-commerce platforms like Shopify, BigCommerce automate; marketplaces like Amazon, eBay may collect on seller's behalf). Display taxes clearly on invoices and receipts. Maintain records for sales tax audit purposes. Deadlines depend on assigned filing frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually); payments are made to each state where nexus exists; late filings incur penalties.

### Filing U.S. Sales Tax Returns from Canada
*   Filing frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually) and due dates vary by state based on sales volume. Remote filing generally through online portals of state Department of Revenue websites. Payment methods include ACH transfer (requires U.S. bank account), international wire (higher fees), or credit card (for small amounts). Common mistakes to avoid include missing exemptions (e.g., for resellers), applying wrong local rates, and currency conversion errors when reporting USD amounts.

# Research Plan: Multi-Payment Gateway Billing System

## Objectives
- Analyze and compare the APIs of various payment gateways.
- Investigate tax compliance requirements in Toronto (HST) and the USA.
- Research modern billing system architecture patterns and best practices.
- Identify standards-based formats for billing/subscription systems.
- Explore extensible ontology frameworks for billing systems.
- Outline security considerations and PCI compliance requirements.
- Research modern UI/UX trends for billing portals.
- Synthesize the findings into a comprehensive research report.

## Research Breakdown
1.  **Payment Gateway API Analysis:**
    *   Research and document the API capabilities of:
        *   Btcpay
        *   Woocommerce
        *   Revenuecat
        *   Lemonsqueezy
        *   Helcim
        *   Square
        *   Stripe
        *   Web3 payment solutions
2.  **Tax Compliance:**
    *   Research HST requirements for Toronto, using the provided HST registration number.
    *   Research US tax reporting standards for online businesses.
3.  **Billing System Architecture:**
    *   Research and document modern billing system architecture patterns (e.g., microservices, event-driven).
    *   Identify best practices for designing and building scalable and extensible billing systems.
4.  **Standards and Frameworks:**
    *   Research and identify standards-based formats for billing and subscription systems (e.g., JSON Schema, OpenAPI).
    *   Explore extensible ontology frameworks relevant to billing systems.
5.  **Security:**
    *   Research and document security best practices for billing systems.
    *   Outline PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance requirements.
6.  **UI/UX Trends:**
    *   Research and analyze modern UI/UX trends for both administrator and user-facing billing portals.

## Key Questions
1.  What are the key differences in API features, pricing, and supported payment methods across the specified payment gateways?
2.  What are the specific HST reporting and remittance requirements for a business in Toronto?
3.  What are the primary tax obligations for a Canadian company selling digital products to US customers?
4.  What are the pros and cons of different architectural patterns (monolithic vs. microservices) for a billing system?
5.  How can JSON Schema and OpenAPI be used to define a standardized billing and subscription model?
6.  What are the most critical security vulnerabilities in billing systems, and how can they be mitigated?
7.  What are the key components of a user-friendly billing portal from both a user and an administrator perspective?

## Resource Strategy
-   **Primary Data Sources:** I will use `batch_web_search` to gather information from the official documentation of the payment gateways, government websites (CRA, IRS), and reputable technical blogs and publications.
-   **Search Strategies:** I will use a combination of broad and specific keywords for my web searches. For example, "Stripe API documentation," "HST registration number 826393555RT0001," "modern billing system architecture," "PCI DSS 4.0 requirements."

## Verification Plan
-   **Source requirements:** I will strive to use at least 2-3 independent, credible sources for each key piece of information. Official documentation and government websites will be given the highest priority.
-   **Cross-validation:** I will compare information from different sources to identify any inconsistencies or contradictions.

## Expected Deliverables
-   A comprehensive research report in markdown format (`docs/billing_system_research.md`), summarizing the findings from all research areas.

## Workflow Selection
-   **Primary focus:** Search-focused workflow. The initial phase of this task is heavily reliant on gathering a large amount of information from various sources. Once the information is gathered, I will move to a verification-focused workflow to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the findings.
-   **Justification:** A search-focused workflow is the most efficient way to tackle the broad scope of this research request. It will allow me to quickly gather the necessary information before diving into the more detailed analysis and verification.

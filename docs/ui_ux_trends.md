The web content provides 6 UX guidelines to enhance the customer's subscription management experience, focusing on ease of finding information and enabling convenient self-service.

### 6 UX Guidelines for a Better Subscription Management Experience

**1. Ensure the subscription experience aligns with your brand experience.**
The subscription management experience should be a seamless extension of the overall account experience. This is achieved by consolidating varied account platform interfaces (e.g., Shopify, Recharge) into a single cohesive UI to prevent customer disorientation.

**2. Clearly present key subscription information.**
Active subscriptions should be displayed by the next order date (soonest to latest). Information should be organized and simplified, including pertinent details and visuals.

**3. Make it easy for the customer to make changes to their subscription.**
Provide customers with options and the ability to make changes such as delaying/expediting delivery, changing quantities, or adding products. Flexibility increases customer retention.

**4. Be sure to highlight the subscription value.**
Remind customers of the value, especially cost savings, by highlighting price savings within the subscription listing in their account. This reinforces the value of each shipment.

**5. Enable add-ons.**
Allow customers to add one-time products to their upcoming subscription without additional checkout hassles (no extra form-filling or credit card entry). This increases average order value (AOV). Promote this feature via emails or on the account page.

**6. Help, donâ€™t hinder customers.**
Do not make it difficult for customers to cancel. While it may seem counterintuitive, making cancellation easy avoids frustration and leaves the door open for future re-subscription. Implement an automated retention flow that offers alternatives (e.g., delay) based on cancellation reasons, but keep it simple and quick. Use friendly language.

# Extensible Ontology Framework

This document describes the implementation of the extensible ontology framework for the multi-payment gateway billing system. The system will use a linked data approach to create a flexible and extensible data model.

## Linked Data

Linked data is a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the web. It is based on the idea of using URIs to identify things, and using RDF to describe them. In our case, we will use a linked data approach to create a flexible and extensible data model for our billing system.

Each entity in our system, such as a user, a subscription, or an invoice, will be assigned a unique URI. We will then use RDF to describe the properties of each entity and the relationships between them. This will allow us to create a rich and interconnected data model that can be easily extended and queried.

## Ontology

An ontology is a formal specification of a set of concepts and the relationships between them. In our case, we will use an ontology to define the concepts and relationships in our billing system. This will allow us to create a shared understanding of the data model, and it will make it easier to develop applications that use the data.

We will use the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to define our ontology. OWL is a standard language for defining ontologies, and it is supported by a wide range of tools and libraries.

## Example

Here is an example of how we might use a linked data approach to describe a user in our system:

```turtle
@prefix : <https://api.example.com/ontology#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<https://api.example.com/users/123>
  a :User ;
  foaf:firstName "John" ;
  foaf:lastName "Doe" ;
  foaf:mbox <mailto:john.doe@example.com> .
```

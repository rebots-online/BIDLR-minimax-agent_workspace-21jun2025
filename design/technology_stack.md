## Deployment Architecture

The system will be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster running on AWS. The cluster will be managed by Amazon EKS, and it will be configured to be highly available and scalable. The system will be deployed using a CI/CD pipeline that is managed by Jenkins. The pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the system to the Kubernetes cluster whenever new code is pushed to the main branch of the Git repository.

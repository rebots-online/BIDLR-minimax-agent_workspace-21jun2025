*   **Payment Gateway Service:** A service that integrates with multiple payment gateways using the adapter pattern. This service will provide a unified interface for processing payments, regardless of the underlying payment gateway. It will also handle the complexities of integrating with each gateway's API.
*   **Tax Service:** A dedicated service for calculating and managing taxes. This service will be responsible for calculating taxes based on the user's location and the products they are purchasing. It will also handle tax reporting and compliance.
*   **Notification Service:** A service for sending email and other notifications to users. This service will be used to send notifications for events such as new invoices, payment reminders, and subscription renewals.
*   **User Service:** A service for managing user accounts and authentication. This service will be responsible for creating and managing user accounts, as well as authenticating users and managing their permissions.

# Payment Gateway Integration

This document describes the design of the payment gateway integration for the multi-payment gateway billing system. The system will use the adapter pattern to integrate with multiple payment gateways, providing a unified interface for processing payments.

## Adapter Pattern

The adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. In our case, we will create a `PaymentGateway` interface that defines the common operations for processing payments, such as `charge` and `refund`. We will then create concrete adapter classes for each payment gateway that we want to support, such as `StripeGateway`, `SquareGateway`, and `PayPalGateway`. Each adapter class will implement the `PaymentGateway` interface and will translate the common operations into the specific API calls for that gateway.

## Code Example (Python)

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaymentGateway(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def charge(self, amount: float, token: str) -> str:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def refund(self, transaction_id: str, amount: float) -> bool:
        pass

class StripeGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def charge(self, amount: float, token: str) -> str:
        # Code to process a charge with Stripe
        pass

    def refund(self, transaction_id: str, amount: float) -> bool:
        # Code to process a refund with Stripe
        pass

class SquareGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def charge(self, amount: float, token: str) -> str:
        # Code to process a charge with Square
        pass

    def refund(self, transaction_id: str, amount: float) -> bool:
        # Code to process a refund with Square
        pass

class PayPalGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def charge(self, amount: float, token: str) -> str:
        # Code to process a charge with PayPal
        pass

    def refund(self, transaction_id: str, amount: float) -> bool:
        # Code to process a refund with PayPal
        pass
```


# Tax Calculation and Compliance

This document describes the design of the tax calculation and compliance module for the multi-payment gateway billing system. The system will be designed to handle HST in Toronto and tax reporting in the USA.

## Tax Calculation

The tax calculation will be handled by a dedicated `Tax Service`. This service will be responsible for calculating taxes based on the user's location and the products they are purchasing. The tax rates will be stored in a `tax_rates` table in the database, which will be updated regularly to ensure that the correct tax rates are being used.

For HST in Toronto, the system will be configured with the HST rate of 13% for all sales to customers in Ontario. The system will also be configured to handle the HST registration number (826393555RT0001) for all invoices and receipts.

For sales to customers in the USA, the system will be configured to handle the different sales tax rates for each state. The system will use a third-party tax service, such as Avalara or TaxJar, to calculate the correct sales tax for each transaction.

## Tax Reporting

The system will generate regular tax reports to help with tax compliance. These reports will include a breakdown of all the taxes that have been collected, as well as the information needed to file tax returns.

For HST in Toronto, the system will generate a report that shows the total amount of HST that has been collected, as well as the information needed to file an HST return with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

For sales to customers in the USA, the system will generate a report that shows the total amount of sales tax that has been collected for each state, as well as the information needed to file sales tax returns with each state's tax agency.


# Security Architecture

This document describes the security architecture of the multi-payment gateway billing system. The system will be designed to be secure and compliant with all applicable security standards, including PCI DSS.

## Data Protection

All sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card numbers, will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Passwords will be hashed using a strong hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt. Credit card numbers will be encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm, such as AES-256.

## Access Control

Access to the system will be controlled by a role-based access control (RBAC) system. Users will be assigned to roles, and each role will have a set of permissions that define what actions they can perform. This will ensure that users only have access to the data and functionality that they need to do their jobs.

## PCI Compliance

The system will be designed to be compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This means that the system will meet all of the requirements for storing, processing, and transmitting credit card data. To achieve PCI compliance, we will:

*   Use a PCI-compliant payment gateway to process all credit card payments.
*   Never store raw credit card numbers on our servers. Instead, we will use tokenization to store a reference to the credit card number that is stored by the payment gateway.
*   Regularly scan our systems for vulnerabilities and patch them as soon as they are found.
*   Implement a strong access control system to ensure that only authorized users have access to credit card data.
*   Maintain a secure network and protect it from unauthorized access.
*   Regularly monitor and test our security systems and processes.


# Extensible Ontology Framework

This document describes the implementation of the extensible ontology framework for the multi-payment gateway billing system. The system will use a linked data approach to create a flexible and extensible data model.

## Linked Data

Linked data is a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the web. It is based on the idea of using URIs to identify things, and using RDF to describe them. In our case, we will use a linked data approach to create a flexible and extensible data model for our billing system.

Each entity in our system, such as a user, a subscription, or an invoice, will be assigned a unique URI. We will then use RDF to describe the properties of each entity and the relationships between them. This will allow us to create a rich and interconnected data model that can be easily extended and queried.

## Ontology

An ontology is a formal specification of a set of concepts and the relationships between them. In our case, we will use an ontology to define the concepts and relationships in our billing system. This will allow us to create a shared understanding of the data model, and it will make it easier to develop applications that use the data.

We will use the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to define our ontology. OWL is a standard language for defining ontologies, and it is supported by a wide range of tools and libraries.

## Example

Here is an example of how we might use a linked data approach to describe a user in our system:

```turtle
@prefix : <https://api.example.com/ontology#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<https://api.example.com/users/123>
  a :User ;
  foaf:firstName "John" ;
  foaf:lastName "Doe" ;
  foaf:mbox <mailto:john.doe@example.com> .
```


# UI/UX Wireframes

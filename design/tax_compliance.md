# Tax Calculation and Compliance

This document describes the design of the tax calculation and compliance module for the multi-payment gateway billing system. The system will be designed to handle HST in Toronto and tax reporting in the USA.

## Tax Calculation

The tax calculation will be handled by a dedicated `Tax Service`. This service will be responsible for calculating taxes based on the user's location and the products they are purchasing. The tax rates will be stored in a `tax_rates` table in the database, which will be updated regularly to ensure that the correct tax rates are being used.

For HST in Toronto, the system will be configured with the HST rate of 13% for all sales to customers in Ontario. The system will also be configured to handle the HST registration number (826393555RT0001) for all invoices and receipts.

For sales to customers in the USA, the system will be configured to handle the different sales tax rates for each state. The system will use a third-party tax service, such as Avalara or TaxJar, to calculate the correct sales tax for each transaction.

## Tax Reporting

The system will generate regular tax reports to help with tax compliance. These reports will include a breakdown of all the taxes that have been collected, as well as the information needed to file tax returns.

For HST in Toronto, the system will generate a report that shows the total amount of HST that has been collected, as well as the information needed to file an HST return with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

For sales to customers in the USA, the system will generate a report that shows the total amount of sales tax that has been collected for each state, as well as the information needed to file sales tax returns with each state's tax agency.

# Security Architecture

This document describes the security architecture of the multi-payment gateway billing system. The system will be designed to be secure and compliant with all applicable security standards, including PCI DSS.

## Data Protection

All sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card numbers, will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Passwords will be hashed using a strong hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt. Credit card numbers will be encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm, such as AES-256.

## Access Control

Access to the system will be controlled by a role-based access control (RBAC) system. Users will be assigned to roles, and each role will have a set of permissions that define what actions they can perform. This will ensure that users only have access to the data and functionality that they need to do their jobs.

## PCI Compliance

The system will be designed to be compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This means that the system will meet all of the requirements for storing, processing, and transmitting credit card data. To achieve PCI compliance, we will:

*   Use a PCI-compliant payment gateway to process all credit card payments.
*   Never store raw credit card numbers on our servers. Instead, we will use tokenization to store a reference to the credit card number that is stored by the payment gateway.
*   Regularly scan our systems for vulnerabilities and patch them as soon as they are found.
*   Implement a strong access control system to ensure that only authorized users have access to credit card data.
*   Maintain a secure network and protect it from unauthorized access.
*   Regularly monitor and test our security systems and processes.
